# Temporary OmniAuth App

Welcome to Temporary OmniAuth App!

## How was this app created?
This Rails app was created with the 
[Rails Neutrino](https://github.com/jhsu802701/rails_neutrino_5) scripts.  The time at which this app was created is denoted in the config/rails_neutrino_timestamp.txt file.

## What's the point?
* Rails Neutrino begins with the "rails new" command and automatically constructs a comprehensive Rails template app that includes the features that all or most Rails apps need.  This 1-step process is completed in minutes, not hours or days.
* This template app is used by the [GenericApp](https://github.com/jhsu802701/generic_app) gem to create a Rails app.  This app is comprehensive, of high quality, and up to date.  A new template app is created periodically for use as the new basis for Generic App.
* Use of this Rails app improves productivity by orders of magnitude when it's time to create a new app.  Features provided through automatic processes include a comprehensive test suite, Bash scripts for common tasks, outlines of the MVC architecture, static pages, and user and admin authentication provided by the Devise gem.

## What should I do after I create this new app?
Further instructions are provided in the README-to_do.txt file.
